            <h3>Internship METU Parabol Software Company</h3>
            <p>July 2024 - September 2024</p>
            <p>
            Backend Development using FastAPI and Django.
            </p>

            <h3>Asynchronous Number Guessing Game </h3>
            <p>
               I developed a game project using Django that implements message queues with RabbitMQ, facilitating efficient communication between Dockerized microservices. 
                This architecture allows for asynchronous processing of game events, enhancing responsiveness and performance. 
                I designed the system to manage user interactions and game state updates, ensuring a smooth user experience.
                Additionally, I integrated Docker for containerization, allowing for easy deployment and scalability of the microservices. 
                This project deepened my understanding of microservices architecture and the importance of messaging systems in distributed applications.

            <h3> API Gateway Implementation for Different Microservices</h3>
                <p>
                    I set up Nginx to efficiently manage, merge, and route traffic between multiple Dockerized services, enhancing the overall performance and scalability of the application. 
                    This involved configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and direct them to the appropriate services while ensuring load balancing and fault tolerance. 
                    This setup streamlined the deployment process and facilitated seamless integration of microservices within the architecture.

                Library Management Project
            </h3>
            <p>
              I developed a simple fullstack library management system using Django, focusing on user-friendly design and functionality. 
                The system includes features such as user authentication, book search, allowing users to easily navigate and manage library resources. 
                I implemented basic templates for the user interface. 
                Throughout the development process, I utilized version control with Git and followed best practices in coding and testing to deliver a reliable application.
